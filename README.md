n-Channel Image
===============

Normally, convolutional neural networks expect images with 1 or 3 input channels, for grayscale and color, respectively. This repository contains an implementation of images with *n* input channels in fastai v1. WARNING: This implementation is now obsolete. [This repository](https://github.com/ianvcaldas/drosophila-sweeps) has a re-implementation in fastai v2.
